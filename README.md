                                  -:Air quality Analysis of Lucknow City :-
                                 


This Project covers -
          Analyzing Air pollution levels in Lucknow over the years from 2015 to 2020.
          

About Dataset:-
The dataset contains air quality data  at  daily level of various stations across multiple cities in India, But I am using only Lucknow's data for analysis.
The data has been made publicly available by the Central Pollution Control Board: https://cpcb.nic.in/ which is the official portal of Government of India. They also have a real-time monitoring app: https://app.cpcbccr.com/AQI_India/



What is AIR Pollution?

Air Pollution:-Air pollution is a mixture of solid particles and gases in the air. Car emissions, chemicals from factories, dust, pollen and mold spores may be suspended as particles. Ozone, a gas, is a major part of air pollution in cities. When ozone forms air pollution, it's also called smog.

Some air pollutants are poisonous. Inhaling them can increase the chance you'll have health problems. People with heart or lung disease, older adults and children are at greater risk from air pollution. Air pollution isn't just outside - the air inside buildings can also be polluted and affect your health.





Types of pollutants:-

A)Particulate Matter:-
Particulate matter (PM) are inhalable and respirable particles composed of sulphate, nitrates, ammonia, sodium chloride, black carbon, mineral dust and water. Particles with a diameter of less than 10 microns (PM10), including fine particles less than 2.5 microns (PM2.5) pose the greatest risks to health, as they are capable of penetrating peoples’ lungs and entering their bloodstream. Sources of PM include combustion engines (both diesel and petrol), solid-fuel (coal, lignite, heavy oil and biomass) combustion for energy production in households and industry, as well as other industrial activities (building, mining, manufacture of cement, ceramic and bricks, and smelting).

B)Black Carbon
Black carbon is a major component of PM2.5 and driver of climate change, also known as a “short-lived climate pollutant." SLCPs persist in the atmosphere for a shorter period compared to CO2. Despite its short atmospheric lifetime, black carbon is one of the largest contributors to global warming after CO2. It also known to decrease agricultural yields and accelerate glacier melting.

C)Ground-level Ozone
Ground-level ozone is one of the major components of photochemical smog and a key health risk linked to breathing problems, asthma, reduced lung function and respiratory diseases. It is a secondary pollutant, meaning that it is not directly emitted. Instead, it is produced when carbon monoxide (CO), methane, or other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are oxidized in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sunlight. In addition to their role as ozone precursors, CO, VOCs and NOx are dangerous air pollutants themselves. Major sources of NOx and VOCs include emissions from motor vehicle exhaust, industrial facilities, and chemical solvents. Major sources of methane include waste and the fossil fuel and agricultural industry. Aside from its health impacts, tropospheric ozone is a short-lived climate pollutant and one of the most important greenhouse gases.

D)Nitrogen dioxide
Nitrogen dioxide, mainly emitted by power generation, industrial and traffic sources, is an important constituent of particulate matter and ozone. There is growing evidence that independently, it can increase symptoms of bronchitis and asthma, as well as lead to respiratory infections and reduced lung function and growth. Evidence also suggests that NO2 may be responsible for a large disease burden, with exposure linked to premature mortality and morbidity from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.

E)Sulfur dioxide
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is primarily produced from the burning of fossil fuels (coal and oil) and the smelting of mineral ores that contain sulphur. Exposure to SO2 affects the respiratory system and the function of the lungs, and causes irritation of the eyes. Inflammation of the respiratory tract from SO2 can aggravate asthma and chronic bronchitis, as well as increases the risk of infection, leading to increased hospital admissions and visits to emergency rooms. SO2 also combines with water in the air to form sulfuric acid - the main component of acid rain.

F)Carbon monoxide
Carbon monoxide (CO) a colourless and odourless gas, which at high levels can be harmful to humans by impairing the amount of oxygen transported in the bloodstream to critical organs. Although high concentrations of CO are more of a concern indoors, emissions outdoors, particularly in developing countries can be high. New evidence also reveals that long-term exposure to low concentrations is also associated with a wide range of health effects. The main sources of ambient CO include motor vehicle exhaust and machinery that burn fossil fuels.
